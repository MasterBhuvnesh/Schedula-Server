# ü§ù Contributing to Event Server

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Event Server as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue a pull request.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable.
2. Update any relevant documentation.
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of the maintainers.

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the MIT License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub Issues

Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/event_server/issues/new).

## Write Bug Reports with Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy environment variables:

   ```bash

   ```

3. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode

- ESLint for linting
- Jest for testing

## Documentation
